# The Web Wand Engine (TWWE)

[中文版](./README.md) | English

A Web-based Noita wand evaluation and synchronization tool. This project aims to provide an intuitive interface for players to analyze wand logic and interact with in-game data in real-time through a dedicated synchronization plugin.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Use the `wand_sync` mod to pull wand data directly from your active Noita session.
- **Logic Evaluation**: A powerful Lua-based engine that simulates wand firing sequences.
- **Modern UI**: A responsive frontend built with React and TailwindCSS.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download & Install (Recommended)
Download the latest portable version from [Releases](https://github.com/NathanSnail/TWWE/releases):
Simply run `TheWebWandEngine.exe` to start.

### 2. In-game Synchronization
Copy the `wand_sync` folder from the package to your Noita `mods` directory and enable it in-game.

## 🛠️ Development & Building (Advanced)

If you wish to compile the project yourself or contribute to development:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js 16+**
- **LuaJIT**: Download `luajit.exe` and place it in the `bin/` directory.

### 2. Configuration
The application prioritizes the `noitadata` folder in the project root. You can rename your extracted game `data` folder to `noitadata` and place it there.

### 3. Installation & Running
```bash
# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/server.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build & Release
- **Local Build**: Run `build_portable.bat` to generate a single-file EXE.
- **Publish to Release**: Ensure [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is installed, then run `publish.bat` to automate: building, Git committing, tagging, and uploading to GitHub Release.
